In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself.

CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.', 'Python is known for its \"batteries included\" philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language\\'s rich library ecosystem.

Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://keralarescue.in', \"I love Pokemon. However, I don't love how some players make the community less welcoming towards beginners by hiding their strategies. So I did what any defiant engineer would. I signed up for a free AWS account and began (responsibly) scraping millions of their unauthenticated Pokemon battles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll journey together through this passion project of mine and draw on specific examples to better understand the trade-offs of working with distributed systems or microservice architectures in the cloud.\", \"Key takeaways:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python's set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPython's set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\", \"Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\\r\\nlong various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful\\r\\nto understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve\\r\\nit. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and\\r\\ntechniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with\\r\\nexisting packages or write your own from scratch.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program\\r\\nis doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of\\r\\nstatistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,\\r\\nyou can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets\\r\\nyou find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core technical focus of the talk is python's sys module and how it\\r\\nlets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks\\r\\nto be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use\\r\\nan existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.\", 'Testing code is important. Testing, primarily unit-testing async code\\r\\nrequires heading off the the standard roadway of unit testing in python. This talk will provide a map to help you along the new path towards testing async code.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopics include:\\r\\n\\r\\n - a brief intro to `asyncio` and challengs in testing with it\\r\\n - running coroutines (and other awaitables) under test\\r\\n - mocking coroutines\\r\\n - testing \"main\" `asyncio` loops', \"People live with mental health stigma because we learn that we're supposed to be strong and resilient. It's okay not to be strong or resilient all the time. Discussing mental illness is uncomfortable. In this talk, I will help you overcome that discomfort by examining the most common mental health issues, how you can get help for yourself, and how you can best support your coworkers, friends, and family. No one should have to deal with mental illness alone. Bring your tissues.\", \"Manually updating a million line code base is tedious. Thankfully syntax trees provide a safe and quick way to  automatically apply repetitive transformations. Leveraging syntax tree based tooling (based on lib2to3), has been a critical component of Pinterest's Python 3 upgrade strategy, and saved us countless hours of work.  Learn how syntax trees work, how they are used to transform code, and how you can quickly write your own transformations.\", 'GraphQL is an exciting technology that can help simplify web logic. Most of the attention has been focused on client-side improvements, such as reducing payload sizes and reducing total number of requests. This talk will show how GraphQL can structure your backend logic to reduce the client-side dependencies or remove them entirely!', \"Seeing the Earth from above is truly breathtaking, but it takes a lot of time, fuel and opportunity - so instead, why not make miniature art of the world's famous terrains?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk explores using Python to take raw terrain data - from aerial lidar and space-based radar scans - and processing it into 3D models, and CAD/CAM toolpaths, with the ultimate result of making Python-powered artwork of some of Earth's natural wonders.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee how to reduce each National Park to a small, intricately-milled metal carving, how to laser-cut a side-on relief of a whole Hawaiian island, or how to 3D print tiny versions of cities where you can make out each individual building - and the strengths and challenges of using Python to handle 3D and GIS data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll also look at some basic 3D modelling code, discuss the wonders of different map projections, and how personal LiDAR is slowly, but surely, becoming affordable.\", 'If you’ve ever `pip install`ed a Python package with C extensions on Linux, it was probably a painful experience, having to download and install development headers for libraries you’ve never even heard of. Maybe you’ve given up on pip and have switched to Conda. But it doesn’t have to be this way! The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment. Come learn to harness the black magic of Python wheels, and you too can spare your users pain… for a price.', 'Inheritance is among the first concepts we learn when studying object-oriented programming. But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.', 'Many developers struggle to find the balance between striving to improve existing code and letting good enough alone by accepting certain shortcomings. As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you can’t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone.', 'The Zen of Python, accessed by running `import this`, is a list of nineteen aphorisms that have guided the development of the language. It has good advice for how to organize our code, but what does it have to say about how we organize ourselves? Plenty: the Zen of Python is not only a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is that it’s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of Python-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of Python has to teach us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety. Come ready to reflect on and feel inspired by a new interpretation of these principles, and bring what you learn back to your meetup, study group, open source project, or team.', \"If you haven't tried multiprocessing or you are trying to move beyond `multiprocessing.map()`, you will likely find that using Python's `multiprocessing` module can get quite intricate and convoluted.  This talk focuses on a few techniques (starting, shutting down, data flow, blocking, etc) that will maximize `multiprocessing`’s efficiency, while also helping you through the complex issues related to coordinating startup and _especially_ shutdown of your multiprocess app.\", 'We will cover how we used Python to adapt to a large institutional processing setup.  We used Python to create the definitions, configuration files, and supplementary metadata for each of the weather radars we worked with.  We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility.  We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.', \"Using the pandas python library requires a shift in thinking that is not always intuitive to those who use it. This talk will take a deep dive into the underlying data structure of pandas to explain why it performs the way it does under certain circumstances. It will explain why a MultiIndex DataFrame takes up less memory than it's simple counter part, why groupby should never be run on a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame, why the example documentation for the pandas apply function is an example of how not to use it, and how not taking the time to normalize data can affect performance.\", 'Having libraries in your Python project properly locked to a specific version is a well known best practice. Dependency management tools in the Python ecosystem lock dependencies to the latest version available, but what if the latest version available is not the best fit for your application? Open source project Thoth is an advanced Python dependency resolver which recommends libraries for your project based on observations that are gathered for Python libraries for specific runtime environments. How these recommendations look like? How are different observations like performance characteristics of machine learning libraries for a particular hardware gathered?', 'One of the reasons why programming in Python is very straightforward and simple is that we do not have to worry about the lifetime of our objects. That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory \"magically\". The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.', \"Why come to yet another talk about CPython's GIL? [1]  Sure, we'll spend a little time on what it is, who it affects (and doesn't), and how to work around it.  However, what you want to come hear is what the future holds for the GIL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll take most of the time talking about life *after* the GIL!  Come see what recent developments and ongoing work will allow us to either circumvent the GIL and get rid of it, unlocking true multi-core capability in Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] In case you don't know, the GIL is a global lock that prevents multi-core parallelism in pure Python code.  It has a controversial place in the community.  Look it up (or come to this talk)!\", \"Type hinting for Python (as a linter tool) came out in September 2015 as part of Python 3.5 (and was championed by Guido himself). Since then, variable annotations (plus, more recently, protocols) improved its capabilities even further. Over the last two years, tools, such as mypy, could build on top of it. Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this presentation, I'll tell my story of using type hints for both adding type hinting and checking type correctness for a library supporting both Python 2 and 3 and reusing this information to insert type data into the generated Sphinx documentation automatically.\", 'Knowing your enemies is as important as knowing your friends.
